# Machine-Learning-of-Extreme-Selfie-Images

Most individuals, especially young people, are obsessed
with taking and sharing selfies online. In the age of TikTok,
Facebook, and Instagram, people earn money with exceptional
images or videos. However, the competition to attract viewers
is not kept safe by the profilers. To some extent, people put
themselves in harm’s way to pursue a perfect selfie shot, causing
cases of getting hurt or even dying while taking selfies. They take
selfies in dangerous locations of mountain peaks, tall buildings,
dangerous wild animals, lakes and many other places, which
leads to many accidents. Therefore, it is a tentative proposition
for the research community to understand the diverse effect
of social media. This paper distinguishes between Selfies and
Extreme-selfie images to detect risky situations by analyzing
the surrounding. We have observed various previous Artificial
Intelligence classical techniques in improving automated and
accurate solutions for image classification. Additionally, we have
used ensemble techniques including VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3,
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121 models for
extreme-selfie identification. It gives predictions based on other
algorithms’ results through an average voting classifier method
and has shown significant success in classifying extreme-selfie
images. Therefore, it outbid all other previous work achieving a
validation accuracy of 97.96% and a test accuracy of 98%.
